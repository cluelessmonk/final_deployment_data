        </h2>
        <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed text-justify">
          Diagnostic technology offers immense potential for innovating newer
          tools in healthcare monitoring. This technology lies at the
          intersection of biotechnology, information technology, and
          electronics. Increasing advancements in these branches of science are
          expected to transform the site of care and configuration of health
          care monitoring. Therefore, the conference intends to bring together
          the experts working around the globe in diverse fields towards
          improvised healthcare system. The scope of the conference covers
          various biomarkers, sensing technologies, platforms, miniaturized
          devices, sensitive signal readers, artificial intelligence and machine
          learning methods being developed or used for global healthcare system.
          This conference holds relevance and becomes significant in light of
          the increasing demand and importance of sensing technology towards
          improving health care facilities. Through various scientific sessions,
          the contributions of the various branches of science and technology in
          developing new generation sensing devices to address the emerging
          healthcare challenges and the needs associated with them would be
          discussed. The broad areas covered in this program includes but not
